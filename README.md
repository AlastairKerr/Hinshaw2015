Details: 
In each chromosome a 50kb region is examined with the centromere in
the centre. (i.e. centromere with 25kb flanks) 500 windows, each 100bp
are taken across this region in each chromosome and the ratio of reads
(normalised to RPM) over input is taken. So for each window we have 16
values, (one per chromosome)
